# Feature-Visualization-UMAP--t-SNE
This repository consists of the feature visualization of VGG-16 deep model by training on CIFAR-10 and MedNIST datasets. This implementation had been done by modifying previously implemented pipeline by Antti Isosalo (https://github.com/aisosalo/). The VGG-16 deep model was utilized to train/evaluate datasets in PyTorch deep learning framework.
